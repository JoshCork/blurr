# blurr
This Repo holds my project 4 learnings and code.  There seemed to be some confusion on my first submission which should have pointed at the gh-pages branch not at the master branch.  I've now merged the gh-pages branch back into master so that there is no confusion.  You can view my optimized pages on the gh-pages branch using the URL below. 

To use this repo you can browse to http://joshcork.github.io/blurr and view the pages that i have optimized. 

All of the classroom material from the coursework is in the folder labled Classroom Material.  

The transformer name I chose for this repo is: Blurr... he is the fastest Autobot on land. He was used primarily by the Autobots as a high speed messenger. Blurr was also portrayed having extremely fast speaking mannerisms, and a nervous streak when dealing with his superiors. Despite this he is a loyal warrior and friend. When he became a Targetmaster he was paired with Haywire, an impulsive and excitable Nebulan youngster.[1]  With his top speed of 800 miles-per-hour, Forbes named Blurr as the fastest fictional car in 2008.
