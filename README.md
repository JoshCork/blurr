# blurr
This Repo holds my project 4 learnings and code.  The transformer name I chose for this repo is: Blurr... he is the fastest Autobot on land. He was used primarily by the Autobots as a high speed messenger. Blurr was also portrayed having extremely fast speaking mannerisms, and a nervous streak when dealing with his superiors. Despite this he is a loyal warrior and friend. When he became a Targetmaster he was paired with Haywire, an impulsive and excitable Nebulan youngster.[1]  With his top speed of 800 miles-per-hour, Forbes named Blurr as the fastest fictional car in 2008.[2]
